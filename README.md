# Medical-Expense-

we are exploring thr data set having medical expense of patients. Medical expence depends on various factors like city of living , type of diagnosis and age etc.. but in this data set we have few factors based on which we are going to perform regression analysis

Steps followed in the project:

1)Exploratory Data Analysis • Missing Value Analysis • Outlier Analysis

2)Feature selection

3)Feature scaling

4)Model Development • Test Train Split • Linear Regression • Model Evaluation

• Performed Linear Regression  on the data set and evaluated the model with the help R_squared value.

• R_squared value stands at 0.74

* Considering the R_squared value obtained in Linear regression , We can see that there is still scope model improvement.

5)Model Development • Test Train Split • Polynomial Regression • Model Evaluation

  •Performed Polynomial Regression  on the data set and evaluated the model with the help R_squared value
  
  •R_squared value stands at 0.84
